<h3> CLAIMS & CREDIT POLICY </h3>

We at GreatCutFlowers, LLC are committed to providing the best products possible. However, as all flowers are perishable, there may be issues on occasion. We have a Claims & Credit Policy in place to work closely with our growers in alerting them to quality issues and/or disease problems. Our growers expect a full report, which is reasonable, and we therefore request that our clients participate in accommodating them.

The simple procedure is outlined below. Thank you in advance for your adherence to our Claims & Credit Policy.

Upon arrival of the product at your facility, please inspect it.
If you encounter any quality issues, damage, shortages, and/or incorrect product, please report it to your GreatCutFlowers, LLC sales representative within 24 hours of receipt of flowers.
We request the following photographs to accompany the claim. Pictures must be in focus and demonstrate the problem and its scope. The images must include the following:
- At least three (3) close-up images that clearly show the problem. If there are multiple boxes, then there should be three images for each box.
- Provide at least one image that shows the entirety of the problem such as picture(s) of all the affected bunched in a group shot. If there are multiple boxes, then panoramic shots of each box's contents will be necessary.
- Photograph(s) of the respective box labels.
- Any other evidence that would support the claim.

A written credit request must accompany the claim which should include the following information:
- Date received
- Invoice number
- Product for which you are requesting credit
- Number of units claimed
- Reason for claim
- Total dollar amount of the claim
- Name of your sales associate

Upon validation of your claim, a credit memo will be issued and sent to you via email or mail.

Please note that we are not responsible for problems occurring during shipping from our location to your facility which include but are not limited to damage.
